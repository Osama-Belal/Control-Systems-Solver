## Problem Statement

It was required to develop a program that solves signal flow graphs and implements Routhâ€™s criteria for stability testing, with the following features:

- Calculates the transfer function of a signal-flow graph.
- Lists forward paths, individual loops, and all combinations of *n* non-touching loops.
- Calculates the values of all deltas, which are used in calculating the transfer function.

## Main Features

- Easy graph drawing
- Calculation of the transfer function of a signal-flow graph
- Visual representation of all forward paths, loops, and every combination of *n* non-touching loops.
- Full representation and calculation of the final Routh table for a given characteristic equation.
- Stability testing of a given system
